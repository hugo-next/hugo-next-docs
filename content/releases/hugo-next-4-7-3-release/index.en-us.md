> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note:** The new version of the Hugo framework has significant changes. The current theme only supports versions between `v0.134.0` and `v0.145.0`.<br/>
> Special thanks to netizen [@JefferyWang](https://github.com/JefferyWang) for contributing the `Twikoo` comment component in the new version. However, the example code within this component contains pseudo-key information, which triggers GitHub's security management requirements and may cause repository submissions to fail. There is currently no other feasible solution. You can only manually click "allow" during the first submission. For more information, refer to: [#793](https://github.com/twikoojs/twikoo/issues/793)

This version release includes over **40** new features added according to the roadmap, as well as bug fixes. For details, see below:
